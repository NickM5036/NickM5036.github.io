            <h3>Dice Game</h3>
            <p>This Java code represents a text-based dice game where the player can choose between two actions: 
                moving one space or rolling two dice to determine the number of spaces to move. The game continues until the player either 
                exits voluntarily or reaches position 100, signifying a win. The code also includes methods to simulate dice rolls and calculate 
                movement based on specific rules, ensuring that the player's progress aligns with the game's objectives.</p>

            <h3>Car Lot</h3>
            <p>This project entails the creation of a Java-based car inventory management system encapsulated within the "CarLot" class. It includes 
                features for adding, selling, and querying cars in the inventory, such as finding cars by attributes like MPG or mileage. Additionally, 
                it enables data persistence by allowing the inventory to be saved to and loaded from a file. This system offers a practical solution for 
                organizing and managing car data in a dealership or inventory management context.</p>

            <h3>BookStore</h3>
            <p>This Java code defines a class named "BookStore" that represents a simple bookstore management system. The class maintains three ArrayLists 
                for books, CDs, and DVDs, as well as separate lists for regular members and premium members. It includes methods for adding items to the inventory, 
                selling items to members, restocking products, and calculating the total inventory value. The code provides basic functionality for managing and tracking inventory, 
                sales to members, and restocking items in a bookstore. It follows a simple command-line interface for user interaction.</p>
